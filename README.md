# Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually

# About Data Set
 - The iris dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset.
 - You can get some documentation with:

# import some data to play with
  iris = datasets.load_iris()

  print('The data matrix:\n',iris['data'])
  print('The classification target:\n',iris['target'])
  print('The names of the dataset columns:\n',iris['feature_names'])
  print('The names of target classes:\n',iris['target_names'])
  print('The full description of the dataset:\n',iris['DESCR'])
  print('The path to the location of the data:\n',iris['filename'])

* The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A. Fisher. The dataset is taken from Fisher's paper. 
Note that it's the same as in R, but not as in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points
